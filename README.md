Mapping of the e1476 mutant for [Choon-tak Kwon](<ckwon@cshl.edu>) at CSHL. Included are R scripts to analyze primary bulk segregant analysis (BSA) data using Illumina sequencing. Inputs to this are tab delimited read count files over segregating sites. This was generated through alternative scripts that can be obtained by contacting [Zak Lemmon](<zlemmon@live.com>) and [Zach Lippman](<lippman@cshl.edu>). 

requisite programs:
1. R

R packages:
